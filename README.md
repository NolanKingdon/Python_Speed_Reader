# Python Speed Reader

This is an application based on the idea that we would read much faster should
our eyes not have to move word to word.

This application will parse files and present them to the user one word at a time.

## Supported Filetypes

- .PDF
**- This is currently being developed and is very hit-or-miss right now
- .DOCX
- .PPTX
- .TXT

I am planning on expanding into .HTML, and improving the .PDF in the future.
